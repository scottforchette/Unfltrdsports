This isn't the first time a video of Myles Garrett has surfaced of him playing pick up basketball. However, this is the first time we have gotten to see this 6'5 275 pound freak fly through the air like he is Zion Williamson's long lost older brother.

Let's think about this for a second. Zion Stands 6'6 280 lbs, almost Identical size to Garrett. But Myles has something no one else in the NBA has. His Brain. That  killer mentality you have to have to be a feared defender in the NFL. And  let's not forget he almost ended Mason Rudolphs life last season after he allegedly called Garrett a racial slur.

Now Im not saying he would be a star in the league. But after this video leaked I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs come knocking.
