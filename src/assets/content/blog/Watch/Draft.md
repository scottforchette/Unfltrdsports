What a difficult time to start a sports and pop culture blog. Ive been planning for a while on how exactly I wanted to roll the new site out. But after spending a long time contemplating, I realized that there will not be a perfect time. I wanted to wait for things to blow over but It seems like things are far from it.  
  
So after giving this more thought, I want to use this platform (with no one on it) to not only share whats going on with the current state of the world/country but I spread a few laughs while we are at it. And although there is no sports and the world has stopped for the time being, the show must go on.
