What an emotional and difficult time to launch a sports and pop culture blog. But Ive been planning for a while on how exactly I wanted to roll out the new site. But after spending a some time contemplating, I realized that there will not be a perfect time. 

After giving this more thought, I want to use this platform (with no one on it) to not only share whats going on with the current state of the country/world but maybe we can talk shit and share a few laughs while we are at it. And although there is no sports and the world has stopped for the time being, the show must go on.
