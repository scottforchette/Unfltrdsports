What an emotional and difficult time to launch a sports and pop culture blog. But Ive been planning for a while on how exactly I wanted to roll out the new site. But after spending a some time contemplating and really over thinking, I realized that there will not be a perfect time.

So I want to use this platform (with no one on it) to not only share what's going on with the current state of our country and the world as we know it. But also maybe we can talk shit and share a few laughs while we are at it. And although there is no sports and the world has stopped for the time being, the show must go on.

We appreciate every reader that accidentally stumbles upon our website and every hater that came just to make fun of us.

One Love,
