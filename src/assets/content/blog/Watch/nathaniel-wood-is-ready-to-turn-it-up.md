# Nathaniel Wood is not one to look past any opponent, but the bantamweight up and comer does want to put it out there that should all go well in New Mexico when he faces John Dodson this weekend, he wouldn’t mind getting a spot on next month’s card in his hometown of London.

“Provided I come out of it with no injuries, there's no reason why I still can't get on that London card,” said Wood. “I'd like that. My fitness would be at its high and I could keep my weight nice and low. So, for me, that would be an ideal scenario.”

Fighting as much as he can in 2020, whether in Rio Rancho, at home in England, or anywhere, for that matter, would be ideal for “The Prospect” as he looks to get some momentum back after being forced to sit out for much of last year due to a broken arm.

Before that injury, Wood was on the fast track at 135 pounds after a trio of UFC finishes over Johnny Eduardo, Andre Ewell and Jose Quinonez that extended his current winning streak to eight. And after a few weeks on vacation with his lady, Wood was raring to go until the brakes were put on him getting a second fight in 2019.
